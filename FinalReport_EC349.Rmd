## Developing a model to predict Yelp Reviews

***Name: Bernardo Serrano***

Yelp is an online platform where users can write reviews that consist of a star rating out of five stars,

Star reviews are a way in which we attempt to quantify and standardize something as subjective as opinions. they are a quick and understandable way in which people can communicate how good of an experience they had, usually with five stars being the highest score and 0 being the worst. For this reason, a good star rating can be pivotal for businesses that aim to attract customers, which makes Yelp - an online review database and website - important. In this analysis, we aim to understand what motivates a user to choose one specific star rating over others, as understanding what influences star ratings might help business orders when trying to elevate their establishment reviews. To do this, this analysis uses the data provided by Yelp in various data sets, which detail information on businesses, user reviews, user profiles, check-ins, and user tips.

This analysis followed the CRISP-DM methodology, which urged us to start by "understanding the business problem".

As stated above, what this analysis aimed to extrapolate from the data was an understanding of what factors influence users to choose any given score when reviewing, as that would help in kowing what leads to high scoring reviews. The data gives us insight in many of the specifics of each business - from the type of establishment to their operational schedule - as well as the specifics of each review and user. Examining the details of each business as well as the specific words of the reviews seem to be the best way this data can give relevant information.

The data sets used included big amounts of data, and in order for the computer to be able to process it all in an efficient matter a lot of it was trimmed or simplified down. The smallet versions of the sets detailing information about user profiles and reviews were used for this reason. The business information data set included many details of each establishment: their name, address and other location details, what category of establishment it fits, attributes of this specific environment, it's average star rating, and operational schedule. Most of these were cleaned up, by turning their data into numerical binary YES/NO (1/0) vectors for easier numerical analysis. Additionally, some data was simplified (operational schedule translated into a simple vector detailing if the establishment closed on weekends). Finally, some unnecessary or repeated variables were eliminated, like the different location variables or attributes columns that did not have enough data and most of them were empty. Review data was largely untouched, in compasiron to the user data, as many columns were deemed not necessary for the analysis (information about how old the user profile is or how many compliments they provide others). To top it all off,

The data in "tip_data" and "checkin_data" was largely discarded as it was determined to not be important enough for the analysis, as information about how often a user uses the app or special tips about establishments is not important for scoring a review. After this was done, the remaining data was compiled in a merged data set that included all relevant variables.

Additionaly, after unsuccessful first attempts as creating a linear model, a user sentiment scores are extracted by performing sentiment analysis on the text of each review. This is a process to extract what the writer was feeling when writing a text by comparing the vocabulary used with lexicons.By assigning a sentiment score to each review, it may prove that the mood and/or specifics of the review experience are influential. 

A linear model using only the sentiment scores is performed, yielding a small p-valua and a Multiple R-squared of 0.1988, which is not a satisfactory result as the model can only explain 19% of the data. A lasso model was used for comparison, which confirmed a 1.114354 mean average error. 

Once the rest of the rest of the important remaining variables are introduced in the model, we are granted a 0.4336 R-squared value. A lasso model was used with the same variables for comparison, yielding a 0.824702 MAE.

Finally, a random forest model was utilized to compare the importance of these variables and at the same time test the accuracy of a model including all variables. 
This testing revealed that the top five more important variables in the model are, in order: "user_average_stars_given", "bing_score", "afinn_score", "user_review_count", "Business_Average_Stars". This gives us insight into the more important factors that establishments should take into account if they decide to look at/change their reviews. A lasso model was used with the same variables for comparison, yielding a 0.8273204 MAE, which is higher than the other model, but using far less variables. 


In this paper, we analysed the data from the Yelp data sets in order to develop a model that can predict the star scoring for Yelp reviews on a business, specifically on restaurants.Three different methods were used: linear regression, lasso, and random forest. After multiple iterations of data cleaning and preparation, the models identified five key factors that influence a star rating, which businesses must look out for and control.
Firstly, businesses must look out for frequent yelp users - as being a serial reviewers with more experience in what makes a good restaurant/establishment influences the star rating massively. On the same vein, more positive reviewers are more likely to review new establishments highly, and so avoiding or addressing negative users carefully might raise reviews. The sentiment analysis provided two factors that can be summarized as the sentiment of each reviewer according to how they wrote the review. Influencing the mood of customers once they leave the establishment is crucial for a good review, so businesses must attempt to control this through attitude, service, ambiance or other factors that may influence emotions. Previous establishment performance and also herd mentality also influences star scores - people ar emore likely to review an establishment lower if that establishment's reviews are already down, which means that for businesses a good start and maintaining that good star rating momentum is imperative.
